# course-agent

Retrieval + agent layer for a UIUC course-planning assistant. Data comes from [AlmaBot](../almabot-web)
(React frontend; its `scripts/build_data.py` exports courses and the prerequisite DAG from `course-catalog.csv`).

## Setup

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Python is pinned to **3.12** via `.python-version` and
`requires-python`: one interpreter version keeps `uv.lock`, indexes and reports reproducible across
machines. The stack also resolves on 3.13/3.14 today, but `chromadb`'s `onnxruntime` dependency has
lagged new CPython releases before, so we stay one version behind the system Python (3.14).
`uv sync` downloads the interpreter if it is missing.

```bash
uv sync --locked         # creates .venv (Python 3.12), installs deps + dev group; fails if uv.lock is stale
cp -n .env.example .env  # then fill in OPENAI_API_KEY (-n never overwrites an existing .env)
uv run pytest -q         # smoke: imports resolve + config hash properties hold
```

Optional local-embedding route (BGE-M3 via `sentence-transformers`): `uv sync --locked --extra local`.
`uv sync` is exact by default, so pass `--extra local` on **every** sync or the extra is removed again;
alternatively use `uv sync --inexact` to leave already-installed extras in place.

```

## Config & reproducibility

All experiment settings live in `config.yaml`; nothing is hard-coded in the modules. `config.py`
loads it into a read-only `Config` whose **config hash** is computed once, at load time: sha256 of
the canonical dump (sorted keys, no whitespace), first 8 hex chars. Changing any value — including
`seed` and the `data.source_sha256` pin — changes the hash; reordering keys does not; list order
matters (`chunk.fields` order defines the chunk template). The mapping is immutable, so the hash
cannot drift between two calls inside one build. For an ablation, copy and rebuild:
`Config({**cfg.to_dict(), "seed": 43})`.

```python
from config import load_config, collection_name, bm25_path, report_path, rel_to_repo, source_path

cfg = load_config()              # read-only; cfg["fusion"]["rrf_k"] works like a dict
cfg.hash                         # "a1b2c3d4", frozen at load
collection_name(cfg)             # "courses_a1b2c3d4"                   Chroma collection
bm25_path(cfg)                   # <repo>/indexes/bm25_a1b2c3d4.pkl     absolute, dir created on demand
report_path("day1_smoke", cfg)   # <repo>/report/day1_smoke_a1b2c3d4.md absolute, dir created on demand
rel_to_repo(bm25_path(cfg))      # "indexes/bm25_a1b2c3d4.pkl"          for reports/logs, never str(path)
source_path(cfg)                 # data.source with ~ expanded; cfg itself is untouched
```

The naming helpers return **absolute** paths so a build works from any cwd; print them through
`rel_to_repo()` so a local home directory never lands in a git-tracked report.

`data.source_sha256` pins the *content* of the input CSV, not just its path. The exporter calls
`verify_source(cfg)`, which refuses a file that does not match, so re-exporting from new data
forces a new hash instead of silently reusing an index built from the old data. After replacing the
CSV, print the new digest with `uv run python config.py --source-digest` and update the pin.

Print the current hash with `uv run python config.py`, and the exact string being hashed with
`--canonical`.

## Data

`ingest/export_almabot.py` re-exports the catalog CSV into `data/`. AlmaBot's `public/courses.json`
cannot be reused: it truncates `desc` to 240 chars (3,255 of 4,502 courses lose text) and carries no
term, so the exporter re-reads the CSV and keeps only the *logic* from `build_data.py` — section
de-duplication, credit parsing, prerequisite extraction.

```bash
uv run python -m ingest.export_almabot   # -> data/{courses,prereqs,requirements}.json + stats
```

4,502 courses (term `2026-sp`), 2,086 prerequisite and 34 corequisite edges, 13 Gen Ed categories.
The outputs are committed, so a clone can build indexes without the private CSV; see
[data/README.md](data/README.md) for the schema, how the requirements block is parsed, and the
known data quality issues.

## Chunking

One course is one chunk — descriptions are short (p50 111 tokens, max 523, against an 8191-token
embedding limit), so splitting would only scatter a course's facts across several vectors.

```bash
uv run python -m ingest.chunk                # -> data/chunks.jsonl + chunks.meta.json, with stats
uv run python -m ingest.chunk --show CS 374  # print one rendered chunk and exit
```

```
doc_id   2026-sp:CS-374
metadata {"code": "CS 374", "subject": "CS", "number": "374", "credits": 4.0, "term": "2026-sp", "prereq_codes": ["CS 173", "CS 225", "MATH 213"], "gened_ids": []}
chroma   {"code": "CS 374", …, "prereq_codes": "CS 173|CS 225|MATH 213", "gened_ids": ""}
text
CS 374 — Introduction to Algorithms & Models of Computation
Credits: 4
Term: 2026-sp
Description: Analysis of algorithms, major paradigms of algorithm design including recursive algorithms, … Same as ECE 374. Prerequisite: One of CS 173, MATH 213; CS 225.
Prerequisites: One of CS 173, MATH 213; CS 225.
Degree Attributes: None
```

That is template `v1`, the default, and the requirements block is in it twice: the catalog runs
the block to the end of the description, so `prereqRaw` is a suffix of `desc`. The last line is
labelled the way the catalog labels the column, *not* "Gen Ed" — it also carries non-Gen-Ed
attributes ("Global Classroom course."), so the authoritative Gen Ed answer is
`metadata.gened_ids`, computed from the rules in `requirements.json`.

The wording of that text is a retrieval parameter, not a detail: it is what gets embedded and
BM25-tokenized. So it is built in `render_chunk(course, template_version, corpus)` and nowhere
else, keyed by `chunk.template_version` in `config.yaml`.

### Templates

Two ship. Which one retrieves better is a Day 4 measurement, not a decision baked into the
baseline, so `v1` renders the catalog fields exactly as #4 specified them, and `v2` makes the two
changes #4 left out:

| | `v1` (default) | `v2` |
|---|---|---|
| The requirements block, which `v1` renders twice (2,732 courses) | as specified | cut from the `Description:` line, label included, and kept once under `Prerequisites:` |
| A cross-reference-only `desc` — `"Same as HIST 283. See HIST 283."` and nothing else (497 courses, 11% of the corpus) | as written, so neither retriever has topical text to match | the `See` clause is followed and the target's description added on a `Description of HIST 283:` line of its own — 496 of the 497 resolve |

```
                    v1                v2
total tokens        522,658           513,445      −50,222 de-duplicated
p50 / p95 / max     111 / 202 / 523   110 / 182 / 446   +41,009 inherited
chunk_key           05d00726          bca89eb0
```

Switching is one line — `chunk.template_version: v2` — then re-run the chunk build and the index
builds, which pick up new names from the moved `chunk_key`. Nothing else in the `chunk` section
moves: both templates read the same seven fields, and `chunk.fields` must list exactly what the
chosen template renders (the build refuses to run otherwise, so the hash can never describe a
corpus that was not built). The build also refuses to write a chunk over the 8191-token limit,
rather than letting the embedding call discover it mid-batch.

`v2` keeps the `Same as ...` sentence it resolved: it is the only place a course's sibling codes
appear (`AAS 357` lists four), so following the reference adds a line instead of replacing one.
The borrowed text is labelled with the course it came from, and has that course's requirements
block stripped as well — 274 of the sources have one, and it describes the source, not the course
doing the borrowing, whose own `metadata.prereq_codes` is empty. Two things `v2` is expected to
cost, both for Day 4 to weigh against the recall it buys: the 496 resolved courses and their 351
sources are 847 chunks whose topical text now appears more than once (up to 8 at a time — `FR 418`
is quoted by seven), and an inherited description is the *source's* answer to "what is this course
about", which is only as true as the catalog's claim that the two are the same course.

`doc_id` is `{term}:{SUBJ}-{NUM}` (`2026-sp:CS-374`), and `metadata` carries `code, subject, number,
credits, term, prereq_codes, gened_ids` for filtering. `chunks.jsonl` is **not** committed: unlike
the exported `data/*.json`, it is rebuilt from them by the command above with no private input.
Its `chunks.meta.json` sidecar records a `chunk_key` — a hash of just the term, strategy, template
version and field list — so an index build can detect chunks left over from another template while
ignoring the `seed` / `bm25` / `fusion` tuning that a Day 4 ablation changes on purpose (the full
`config_hash` of the run is recorded too, but only as a record of who wrote the file). See
[data/README.md](data/README.md#chunksjsonl).

## Day 1 goal

End-to-end `query → dense + BM25 recall → RRF → top-k`:

```python
from retrieval import retrieve
retrieve("machine learning courses", mode="hybrid")   # mode ∈ {dense, bm25, hybrid}
```

- Each retriever returns top-20; RRF `score(d) = Σ 1/(60 + rank_i(d))`; keep top-5 after fusion
- One interface for all three modes so the Day 4 ablation reuses it directly
- Acceptance: hand-check top-5 for 5 queries

Progress is tracked in GitHub Issues (milestone: Day 1).
